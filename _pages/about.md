## My Journey in Cybersecurity

I'm Greg Lewis, a Security Analyst with over 4 years of cybersecurity experience, currently working on federal defense contracts in the DMV area. My career has taken me from Help Desk support through Security Engineering to my current role as a SOC Analyst, where I monitor threats, investigate incidents, and protect critical government systems.

I hold a Master's in Cybersecurity Technology from UMGC, a Bachelor's in Computer Networks & Cybersecurity, and maintain my CompTIA Security+ CE certification. Beyond credentials, I'm passionate about hands-on learning - which is why I built an extensive home lab where I continuously sharpen my skills.

## What Drives Me

My faith as a Christian fundamentally shapes how I approach cybersecurity work. I believe this field is about more than just technology - it's about protecting people, stewarding data responsibly, and doing what's right even when it's difficult. Security requires integrity, and my values guide every technical decision I make.

## Current Focus

I'm actively transitioning into Cloud Security Engineering roles, combining my SOC experience with cloud platform expertise. My home lab serves as my training ground, where I explore AWS security architecture, Infrastructure as Code with Terraform, SIEM deployments, and purple team operations.

Outside of cybersecurity, I'm a devoted husband, Muay Thai practitioner, anime enthusiast, and someone who believes in continuous growth - professionally, personally, and spiritually.

## Let's Connect

I'm always interested in connecting with others in the cybersecurity community, especially those who value integrity and purpose in their technical work.
