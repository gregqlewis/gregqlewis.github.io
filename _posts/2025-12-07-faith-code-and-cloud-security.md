I'm a proud Christian, devoted husband, and passionate Security Analyst with a deep love for technology and cybersecurity. I've built a career supporting government contracts with trusted Federal partners, and I hold a CompTIA Security+ CE certification, a Master's in Cybersecurity Technology, and a Bachelor's in Computer Networks & Cybersecurity.

Outside of work, I enjoy spending time with my wife and loved ones, watching the latest anime and other shows, training Muay Thai and working out at the gym, and diving into tech projects and games.

This blog is my space to share my journey as I transition into Cloud Security Engineering, all while staying true to my faith and values. Whether I'm navigating complex challenges in cybersecurity or strengthening my role as a husband and leader, my faith serves as my foundation and guide.

## What You'll Find Here

**Purple Team Projects**: Offensive and defensive security operations from my home lab. I'll document penetration testing exercises with Kali Linux, threat detection with Wazuh, vulnerability assessments, and the attack/defend scenarios that sharpen real-world security skills.

**Technical Projects**: Infrastructure builds and security implementations - from deploying SIEM stacks to automating cloud security with Terraform and AWS. Check out my code and detailed project documentation on [GitHub](https://github.com/gregqlewis).

**Skill Building**: Follow along as I learn Python programming, explore new security tools, work toward certifications, and continuously expand my offensive and defensive security capabilities.

**Faith & Technology**: My faith isn't just part of who I am—it's the compass for everything I do. I believe cybersecurity is about more than just technology; it's about protecting people and doing what's right. Here, I'll share how my values as a Christian shape my approach to this work and the decisions I make every day.

At the heart of this blog is a commitment to growth—professionally, personally, and spiritually. I hope that by sharing my experiences, I can connect with others who value integrity, hard work, and faith in their own journeys.

Whether you're here for cybersecurity insights, a glimpse into my projects, or just to connect, I'm glad to have you along. Let's walk this path together.
